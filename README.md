Welcome to Lemonade Stand! Where you have 7 days to sell lemonade and make as much money as 
possible! You’ll have complete control over your business, including pricing, quality control,
 inventory control, and purchasing supplies. The first thing you’ll have to worry about is 
your recipe. At first, go with the default recipe, but feel free to put your own twist on it.
Make sure you buy enough of all your ingredients, or you won’t be able to sell! The weather 
will also factor into whether or not customers decide to buy your lemonade. Make sure you read
 the weather report every day! When the temperature drops, or the weather condition is less 
inviting (overcast, cloudy, rainy), don’t expect them to buy nearly as much as they would on 
a hot day that is sunny or hazy. Feel free to set your prices higher on those hot, muggy days
 too, as you’ll make more profit, even if you sell less lemonade. At the end of 7 days you’ll
see how much money you made. Remember, with great lemonade comes great responsibility!
